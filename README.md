Welcome to the Sounds Listener app support page

This application listens to sounds around you. When the sound is heard, your iPhone and / or Apple Watch will let you know if it was louder than the setting. You can set up the iPhone to turn on haptic, light, sound alarms on the iPhone, and sound and haptic alarms on the Apple Watch. You can also adjust the microphone sensitivity and alarm duration. If it is expected that the iPhone will work for a long time with the application turned on, it is recommended to connect the power adapter.
