### Welcome to the Sounds Listener app support page

This application listens to sounds around the iPhone. When sound is heard, the iPhone and / or Apple Watch will inform you. You can set the iPhone to turn on haptic, light, and audible alarms on the iPhone, and audible and haptic alarms on the Apple Watch. You can also adjust the microphone sensitivity and alarm duration. If it is expected that the iPhone will work for a long time with the application turned on, it is recommended to connect the power adapter.
